* [Sanity (CMS) Studio](https://tblearn.sanity.studio/desk)
* [Gatsby Preview hosted on Gatsby Cloud](https://preview-tblearnmain.gatsbyjs.io/)
* [Live site hosted on Gatsby Cloud](https://sitebuilderv2.gatsbyjs.io/)

## How to install and run the project

### Node/NPM versions

* node v18.13.0
* npm v8.19.3

### Install

1. Git clone project
2. Install Lerna `npm install -g lerna@6.6.2` 
3. Install Sanity cli `npm install -g @sanity/cli@3.12.2`
4. Install Gatsby cli `npm install -g gatsby-cli@5.6.0`
5. Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` from the root folder of the repo. This should install npms in both packages (studio + web).

### Run Sanity CMS locally

*Even though you can start the studio from the root, we prefer to cd into the folder directly as it provides better terminal logs when things go awry.*

1. `cd packages/studio` from root
2. Log into Sanity account if opening the studio for the first time by typing `sanity login` and follow the prompts
3. Start the Sanity Studio in develope mode with the command `sanity dev`
4. If you have incorrect redential you should logout using `sanity logout` and repeat from step 2
5. Access Sanity development server on `localhost:3333`

### Run Gatsby locally

*Even though you can start Gatsby from the root, we prefer to cd into the folder directly as it provides better terminal logs when things go awry.*

1. `cd packages/web` from root
2. Run `gatsby develop`
3. Access Gatsby development server on `localhost:8000`
4. Access GraphiQL on `localhost:8000/___graphql`
5. View a list of all available pages on `localhost:8000/404`

## Setup Notes

Please use node 18.13.0 and npm 8.19.3.

This is a lerna mono repo, to install for all packages run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` from the root folder. Refer to the **Script Overview** section below for details.

This project is set up with eslint and prettier following Airbnb template + custom rules. The code will be auto linted and fixed precommit (set up via husky + lint-staged). This [ref for precommit linting](https://laurieontech.com/posts/husky/) is used for set up. The difference is that we have used a .lintstagedrc file for the lint-staged configuration instead of putting the instructions directly in the package.json file. The prettier command is not included as it is integrated in to eslint already.

### Important Package Versions

* "sanity": "^3.0.0"
* "gatsby": "^5.5.0"

## Scripts Overview

All the common commands can be accessed directly via the root folder via `npm run <script-name>` . We no longer have to access the sub folders to start local servers / deploy / etc. Here are the common commands that we will access.
* [sanity:dev] - starts local sanity dev server
* [sanity:deploy] - deploys Sanity graphql then the studio
* [gatsby:dev] - starts local gatsby dev server
* [gatsby:clean] - remove .cache and public folders in /web
* [clean] - removes all node modules in the individual packages folder (node modules should only exist for root)

**Breaking change for Studio script**
Sanity has repurposed the [start] command. [sanity start] will now start a preview for the static builds. To run a development server from the studio folder, use the [npm run dev] or [sanity dev] command instead.

## Using Lerna^6.6.2

### Clean up node modules

Run `npm run clean` or `lerna clean -y` from the root folder to remove node modules for the packages. The node_modules folder at root level will need to be deleted manually.

### Add NPM dependencies to the project's packages

Use `lerna add a` to install a new dependency to all managed packages. You can scope the add command to individual packages using the `--scope=<package-name>` flag. This will install a given dependency only to `<package-name>`:
```
lerna add a --scope=b

# add package "a" to multiple packages
lerna add a --scope=b --scope=c --scope=d  
```

Hereâ€™s a concrete example installing **dotenv** as a dependency to the **@siteBuilderV2/web** package:
```
lerna add dotenv --scope=@siteBuilderV2/web  
```

Run `npm run clean` should you accidentally installed a dependency inside the package itself then rerun `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` from the root folder.

## Migration

### Sanity migration

1. [Step by step guide](https://www.sanity.io/docs/example-migrating-the-blog-template-from-studio-v2-to-v3)

2. [Migrating the CLI - This migrates sanity.json to sanity.cli.js](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-the-cli)

3. [Studio configuration - This migrates the other part of sanity.json to sanity.config.js. We are not currently using workspaces.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-studio-configuration)

4. [Schema and schema types - This one is used migrate custom input components and preview components.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-schema-types)

5. [Preview list view - This is the current document that has been helpful for custom input components and preview components.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/previews-list-views)

6. [Structure Builder - The majority of the migration has been completed but the custom preview (of button, form, section) has not been yet implemented.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-custom-structure-and-default-document-node)

7. [Migrating Plugins](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-plugins)

8. [Document actions](https://www.sanity.io/docs/document-actions)

### Gatsby Migration

We technically didn't 'migrate', we installed the newest V5 and slowly moved the stuff into it.

1. [Migrate v3 to v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/) No action was required

2. [Migrate v4 to v5](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/)

**Some highlights**

Change to IE support
Updated sort
Set up trailing slash to never instead of using a package to achieve this
Migrate to head api instead of using gatsby-react-helmet or react-helmet
When you start up the playground it will be GraphiQL now
removal of use of <StaticQuery />
All dependencies were reinstalled to gatsby v5 compatible other than gatsby-theme-material-ui (they need to update their dependency still)
Material UI migration

3. [Migrating to v5 getting started](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migration-v4/) only code mod is needed here

4. [Style change](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/v5-style-changes/)

5. [Component changes](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/v5-component-changes/)

**Notes**

The sx prop is the preferred way to style one offs. The styled utility is used to create reusable styled components.

### Update to 'Serializer' code

We have moved off the: [deprecated package](https://github.com/sanity-io/block-content-to-react) to the new [portable text to react.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/portable-text-to-react)
